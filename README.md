# S&P 500 Companies Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to gain insights from publicly available data. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about S&P 500 companies, including their market capitalization, revenue, and sector classification. Through data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, we explore trends and patterns to answer the following questions:

1. Which sectors dominate the S&P 500?
2. What is the relationship between market cap and revenue?
3. How are market caps distributed across the dataset?

The project includes all relevant Python scripts, visualizations, and a summary of findings.

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: [Kaggle - S&P 500 Companies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks)
- **Format**: CSV
- **Content**:
  - `Company Name`: The name of the company.
  - `Sector`: The sector to which the company belongs.
  - `Market Cap`: Market capitalization of the company (in billions).
  - `Revenue`: Annual revenue of the company (in billions).

## Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate rows to ensure unique entries for each company.
- Handled missing values in critical columns (`Market Cap`, `Revenue`, and `Sector`) by removing rows with missing or invalid data.
- Converted the `Market Cap` and `Revenue` columns to numeric types for proper analysis.

### 2. Data Manipulation
- Sorted the dataset by `Market Cap` to identify the largest companies.
- Grouped data by `Sector` to calculate average market cap and revenue for each sector.

### 3. Data Visualization
Three key visualizations were created:
- **Bar Chart**: Average market cap by sector.
- **Pie Chart**: Sector distribution of companies.
- **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between market cap and revenue.

### 4. Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
- Correlation analysis between market cap and revenue.

## Key Insights

### Sector Analysis
- The **Technology** sector has the highest average market capitalization, making it the dominant sector in the S&P 500.
- **Healthcare** and **Financials** sectors also have significant representation and market value.

### Market Cap Distribution
- The market cap distribution is highly right-skewed, with a small number of companies having exceptionally high market caps.
- Most companies fall into the small to mid-cap range.

### Revenue vs Market Cap
- A strong positive correlation (â‰ˆ 0.85) exists between market cap and revenue, suggesting that companies with higher revenues tend to have larger market caps.
